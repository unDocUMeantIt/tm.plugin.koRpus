ChangeLog for package tm.plugin.koRpus

changes in version 0.02-1 (2018-05-01)
unreleased:
  - this release is under development
changed:
  - vignette: also includes info on readCorpus()
added:
  - kRp.hierarchy: new S4 class to replace kRp.sourcesCorpus and
    kRp.topicCorpus to allow more generic nesting of hierarchical levels
  - readCorpus(): new function to generate kRp.hierarchy objects recursively
  - removed all code regarding simpleCorpus(), sourcesCorpus() and topicCorpus(),
    their object classes and methods; this is all handled much more flexible
    by kRp.hierarchy and readCorpus() now

changes in version 0.01-4 (2018-03-07)
fixed:
  - sourcesCorpus(): speak of "text" instead of "texts" if it's only one
changed:
  - adjusted package to support koRpus >= 0.11 and sylly, especially with
    regards to summary(), hyphen(), and new class contructors
  - summary(): for more coherence with the koRpus package the "text" column
    in the summary slot was renamed into "doc_id"
  - reaktanz.de supports HTTPS now, updated references
  - vignette is now in RMarkdown/HTML format; the SWeave/PDF version was
    dropped
  - hyphen()/lex.div()/readability(): 'quiet' is now TRUE by default
  - lex.div(): 'char' is now an emtpy string by default; computing all
    characteristics was not a useful default for large text corpora
added:
  - README.md
  - new [, [<-, [[ and [[<- methods added for corpus object classes
  - new methods tif_as_tokens_df() to export corpus objects as a single
    data.frame in fully TIF compliant format
  - summary(): now also includes the total number of stopwords (if available)
  - new class object contructors kRp_corpus(), kRp_sourcesCorpus(), and
    kRp_topicCorpus() can be used instead of new("kRp.corpus", ...) etc.

changes in version 0.01-3 (2016-07-12)
fixed:
  - the arguments that simpleCorpus() was supposed to pipe to DirSource()
    weren't used
changed:
  - the "paths" argument of topicCorpus() now expects a list, not a vector
  - using the parallel package to be able to use more CPU cores
added:
  - new argument "format" for simpleCorpus(), sourceCorpus(), and
    topicCorpus(), to be able to work with text objects directly, instead of files

changes in version 0.01-2 (2015-07-08)
changed:
  - using the S4 methods of koRpus 0.06-1 now, therefore renamed all methods
    removing the *.corpus suffix (e.g., lex.div.corpus() is now lex.div())
  - renamed classes into kRp.corpus, kRp.sourcesCorpus and kRp.topicCorpus,
    and their generator functions accordingly
added:
  - new methods read.corp.custom(), freq.analysis() and summary()
  - new getter/setter methods: corpusSources(), corpusTopics(), corpusFreq(),
    corpusSummary()
  - first basic unit tests, using the testthat package
  - new option "summary" for lex.div() and readability(), to automatically
    update the summary data.frames
  - first notes in a vignette

changes in version 0.01-1 (2015-06-29)
added:
  - initial release
