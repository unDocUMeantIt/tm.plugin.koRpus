Reality Leigh Winner (born December 1991) is a federal contractor with Pluribus International Corporation, which provides intelligence services to the United States government. On February 13, 2017, she was assigned to work in a U.S. government facility in Georgia. Winner was arrested on June 5, 2017 on suspicion of leaking an intelligence report detailing Russia's involvement in the 2016 presidential election to the news website The Intercept.

On the day that Winner was arrested, The Intercept had published a lengthy article on alleged Russian attempts to interfere with the US Presidential election, based on classified National Security Agency (NSA) documents leaked to them anonymously.

Based on the arrest warrant issued for Winner, the NSA realized the documents had been printed out because the copies sent by The Intercept showed that the documents "appeared to be folded and/or creased, suggesting they had been printed and hand-carried out of a secured space". The FBI was then able to identify the printer steganography tracking dots identifying the document as having been printed 2017/05/09 at 6:20 from a Xerox printer with serial number #5429535218. This led them directly to Winner.

WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange called on the public to support Winner, offering a $10,000 reward for information about a reporter for The Intercept, who had disclosed identity of Winner. Assange posted on Twitter: "Reality Leight Winner is no Clapper or Petraeus with "elite immunity". She's a young woman against the wall for talking to the press."
